# Docker Compose

This document provides a guide for deploying PenX with Docker Compose.

## Create docker-compose.yml

To deploy PenX with docker compose, create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  penx-self-hosted:
    image: penxio/penx:postgresql-latest
    container_name: penx-self-hosted
    environment:
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET={{jwt_secret}}
      - DATABASE_URL={{postgresql_database_url}}
      - REDIS_URL={{redis_url}}
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

If you use MySQL, use image: `penxio/penx:mysql-latest`.

## Start the containers

Now, execute `docker-compose up -d` to start PenX service.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Upgrading

When a new version of PenX is released, the application can be upgraded with the following commands, run in the directory with the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

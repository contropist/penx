# runAppleScript

The `runAppleScript` function allows you to execute AppleScript in Command App.

This can be particularly useful for automating tasks on macOS, as AppleScript can control many aspects of the operating system and its applications.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here is a simple example of how to use runAppleScript to run a basic AppleScript command and get the result:

```ts
import { runAppleScript } from '@penxio/api'

const result = await runAppleScript('return "unicorn"')

console.log(result)
//=> 'unicorn'
```

n this example, the AppleScript command return "unicorn" is executed, and the result is logged to the console.

### Using Arguments

You can also pass arguments to your AppleScript. This is useful when you need to customize the script's behavior based on dynamic input:

```ts
import { runAppleScript } from '@penxio/api'

const res = await runAppleScript(
  `
    on run argv
      return "hello, " & item 1 of argv & "!"
    end run
  `,
  ['PenX'],
)

console.log(res)
//=> 'hello, PenX!'
```

In this example, the AppleScript is designed to take an argument (argv) and return a greeting message. The argument 'PenX' is passed to the script, resulting in the output 'hello, PenX!'.

## API

The runAppleScript function has the following signature.

To executing a static script:

```ts
function runAppleScript<T>(
  script: string,
  options?: {
    humanReadableOutput?: boolean
  },
): Promise<T>
```

To executing a script with Arguments:

```ts
function runAppleScript<T>(
  script: string,
  arguments: string[],
  options?: {
    humanReadableOutput?: boolean
  },
): Promise<T>
```

**Parameters**

- script: A string containing the AppleScript code to be executed.
- arguments: An array of strings to pass as arguments to the script.
- options: An optional object to configure the execution.
  - humanReadableOutput: A boolean that determines the output style. When set to true (default), the output is human-readable. When set to false, the output is in a recompilable source form.

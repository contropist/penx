# Create First Extension

This a guide to build a minimal extension and debug in PenX.

## Prerequisites

Before write the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites.

- you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.
- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
- You are familiar Javascript or TypeScript.

## Clone the sample extension

Clone the sample plugin using Git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:penxio/extension-template-minimal.git
```

## Develop your extension

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd penx-extension-sample
npm install # install the dependencies
npm run dev # compile the source code
```

Running npm run dev will compile the source code and automatically load the sample extension in PenX.

Open the PenX Command palette, and you will see the `Hello world` commands:

## Important files

The project consists of the following key files:

- `manifest.json`
- `hello.command.ts`

### `manifest.json`

The manifest.json file contains metadata about the project.

```json {8,10}
{
  "name": "Hello world",
  "id": "hello-world",
  "description": "This is a hello wold demo.",
  "icon": "logo.svg",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "hello",
      "title": "Hello world",
      "runtime": "worker"
    }
  ]
}
```

The **command name** is associated with the `[commandName].command.ts` file, which is a very important convention.

- hello -> `src/hello.command.ts`

### `hello.command.ts`

The `hello.command.ts` file will render the "Hello World" string:

```ts
import { MarkdownBuilder, render } from 'penx'

export async function main() {
  render(new MarkdownBuilder('# Hello world'))
}
```

## Test it in PenX

Open Penx and run the `Hello world` command:

🎉 Congratulations! You built your first extension successfully.

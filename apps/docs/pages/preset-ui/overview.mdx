# Preset UI

## Introduction

Not everyone is a front-end developer capable of designing and developing interfaces from scratch.

That's why PenX offers Preset UI. With just JavaScript knowledge, users can quickly develop PenX extensions using the PenX extension API.

## When To Use Preset UI

In most cases, you should use Preset UI for its higher development efficiency and better performance.

If Preset UI doesn't meet your complex UI needs, consider using Custom UI.
